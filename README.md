# Huddle | Aston University | CS2010 Group Project | Group 5

Huddle is an exciting puzzle and strategy game where, as a shepherd, you must herd rebellious sheep into a pen whilst overcoming obstacles, losing as few sheep as possible along the way!


Warehouse theme added.


Additional themes to be implemented.


.gitignore is now properly implemented, when the project is executed the auto-generated files such as .meta and temp from Unity and C# are successfully ignored.
